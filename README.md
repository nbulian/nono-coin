# Nono Coin

This code have been written base on the Udemy course [Breaking Down Bitcoin](https://www.udemy.com/course/breaking-down-bitcoin/)

The instructor approach was "Learn how to build Bitcoin from scratch, in JavaScript!" but I decided to add a bit more of fun doing it with Python. Let's see how it goes!
